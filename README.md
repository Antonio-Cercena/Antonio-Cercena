Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My focus right now is on mastering Python, with a special emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming. I'm passionate about learning and growing in the field of computer engineering, and I'm constantly working on projects to refine my skills.
In addition to Python, I have some familiarity with Java, which has helped me broaden my understanding of programming concepts and practices.
I'm in the process of transitioning into a career in Computer, Electrical, Software, or Hardware Engineering. This GitHub profile is a reflection of my learning progress, coding experiments, and projects related to these areas.
Feel free to explore my repositories, check out my projects, and connect with me. I'm always open to collaboration, advice and feedback!
Happy coding! ðŸš€
